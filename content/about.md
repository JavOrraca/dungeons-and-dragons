# Adulting with Dungeons & Dragons

My name is Jav and gaming has always been a part of my life. I convinced a few friends to learn D&D together so I volunteered to be the Dungeon Master ("DM") for D&D Starter Set campaign, _The Lost Mine of Phandelver_.

I've always enjoyed storytelling, fantasy, gaming, envisioning crazy worlds, and spending time with friends. As I write this, COVID-19 is forcing us to practice social distancing and roleplaying with friends (over teleconferencing tools - we're using Skype) has been a much needed escape.

The main purpose of this blog is to track our campaign's progress and as DM, I hope to share helpful D&D resources for new players and DMs alike.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
