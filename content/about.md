# Adulting with Dungeons & Dragons

My name is Jav and gaming has always been a part of my life. I convinced a few friends to learn D&D together so I volunteered to be the Dungeon Master ("DM") for the D&D Starter Set campaign, _The Lost Mine of Phandelver_.

I've always enjoyed storytelling, fantasy, gaming, envisioning crazy worlds, and spending time with friends. As I write this, social distancing directives are in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Roleplaying with friends over teleconferencing (we're now using Google Meet) has been a surprisingly fun and intellectually stimulating social escape.

The main purpose of this blog is to track our campaign's progress and as new DM to the D&D world, I hope to share helpful resources for new players and DMs alike. So, there you have it... enjoy!
