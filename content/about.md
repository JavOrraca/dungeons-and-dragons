# Adulting with D&D

My name is Jav and fantasy + gaming has always been part of my life. I convinced a few friends to learn D&D together so I volunteered to be the Dungeon Master ("DM") for D&D Starter Set campaign, _The Lost Mine of Phandelver_.

I've always enjoyed storytelling, fantasy, gaming, envisioning crazy worlds, and spending time with friends... As I write this, COVID-19 is forcing us to practice social distancing and what better way to connect with friends than an interactive storybuilding game that we create together.

The main purpose of this blog is to track our campaign's progress but as DM, I'll be sure to share D&D resources that I find helpful and other links / books that are must-haves for new players and people interested in D&D.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
