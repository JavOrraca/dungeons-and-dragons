As the cave mouth is approached, a sudden snap in the thickets puts the adventurers on alert. The captured goblin tries to alert someone but he's silenced by the sight of swords drawn to his face. A hidden goblin blasts an arrow through the thickets towards Gremdar of Frostbeard but the arrow bounces off the cleric's armor.

> SUddenly, combat is all around the adventurers. Bhreac Deargbeerd, the only fighter of the group, was quick to send an arrow towards the goblin. The goblin was only snipped. TBD
