<p>The last time that I played D&amp;D was in 1997&hellip; Times were great for a 13-year old. I was in middle school, Nintendo was dropping amazing games (<em>Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Goldeneye</em>), Magic the Gathering was gaining steam, and &ldquo;responsibilities&rdquo; weren&rsquo;t even in my vocabulary. Let&rsquo;s flash-forward 25 years&hellip; D&amp;D is a welcome escape to connect with friends in a time when social distancing has taken a toll on us all.</p>

<p><a href="https://company.wizards.com/">Wizards of the Coast</a> released Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition several years ago and the internet is packed with solid resources for new D&amp;D players and Dungeon Masters (&ldquo;DMs&rdquo;). Being that I took a 25-year break between D&amp;D gaming, these were some of my favorite online resources to reacclimate myself with the world of D&amp;D and the rules of the 5th edition.</p>

<h1 id="d-d-resources-from-wizards-of-the-coast"><em>D&amp;D Resources from Wizards of the Coast</em><a href="#d-d-resources-from-wizards-of-the-coast" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>

<p>Even the &ldquo;basic rules&rdquo; (180 pages) of D&amp;D can feel super overwhelming. For beginners, I think the best product investment and effort-for-fun-ratio come from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0786965592/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_M7qSEb9K46JXH">D&amp;D Starter Set (~ $20 USD on Amazon)</a>. This comes with a super compact rulebook (30 pages&hellip; still a lot, but better than 180!), pre-made character sheets, and pre-built adventures to get you familiarized with D&amp;D roleplaying and combat mechanics.

<p>Nate at <a href="https://www.wasd20.net/">WASD20</a> shares incredible content on YouTube and his website for getting starting with D&amp;D 5e and has a four-part YouTube series that takes you from the general mechanics of D&amp;D, to a sample encounter, to understanding the nuances of spellcasting:</p>

<p>Matt Mercer is the DM for a D&amp;D group of professional voice actors and watching them improvise is a pleasure to say the least. Pure talent from this crew and so much to admire about the way in which they create worlds together. I jumped right into Critical Role&rsquo;s second campaign since the recently released (March 2020) D&amp;D <em>Explorer&rsquo;s Guide to Wildemount</em> is based on this campaign series. Below is the first episode (of <em>MANY</em>) of Critical Role&rsquo;s second D&amp;D campaign as well as some additional D&amp;D resources that Critical Role has compiled:</p>
