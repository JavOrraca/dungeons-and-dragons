      <description>As the cave mouth is approached, a sudden snap in the thickets puts the adventurers on alert. The captured goblin tries to alert someone but he&amp;rsquo;s silenced by the sight of swords drawn to his face. A hidden goblin blasts an arrow through the thickets towards Gremdar of Frostbeard but the arrow bounces off the cleric&amp;rsquo;s armor.
 SUddenly, combat is all around the adventurers. Bhreac Deargbeerd, the only fighter of the group, was quick to send an arrow towards the goblin.</description>

      <description>Over five hundred years ago, a pact was made between a clan of gnomes and dwarves which became known as the Phandelver Pact. Together they mined the magically rich ores within Wave Echo Cave. Human spellcasters from nearby Phandalin joined forces with them and together they combined their collective skills to create a forge to craft magical items dubbed the Forge of Spells. Everything came to an abrupt end when orcs, craving magical treasures, besieged Phandalin and the Wave Echo Cave mine.</description>
