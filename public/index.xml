      <description>As the cave mouth is approached, a sudden snap in the thickets puts the adventurers on alert. The captured goblin tries to alert someone but he&amp;rsquo;s silenced by the sight of swords drawn to his face. A hidden goblin blasts an arrow through the thickets towards Gremdar of Frostbeard but the arrow bounces off the cleric&amp;rsquo;s armor.
 SUddenly, combat is all around the adventurers. Bhreac Deargbeerd, the only fighter of the group, was quick to send an arrow towards the goblin.</description>

      <description>Over five hundred years ago, a pact was made between a clan of gnomes and dwarves which became known as the Phandelver Pact. Together they mined the magically rich ores within Wave Echo Cave. Human spellcasters from nearby Phandalin joined forces with them and together they combined their collective skills to create a forge to craft magical items dubbed the Forge of Spells. Everything came to an abrupt end when orcs, craving magical treasures, besieged Phandalin and the Wave Echo Cave mine.</description>

      <description>Adulting with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons My name is Jav and gaming has always been a part of my life. I convinced a few friends to learn D&amp;amp;D together so I volunteered to be the Dungeon Master (&amp;ldquo;DM&amp;rdquo;) for D&amp;amp;D Starter Set campaign, The Lost Mine of Phandelver.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed storytelling, fantasy, gaming, envisioning crazy worlds, and spending time with friends. As I write this, COVID-19 is forcing us to practice social distancing and roleplaying with friends (over teleconferencing tools - we&amp;rsquo;re using Skype) has been a much needed escape.</description>

      <description>The core of D&amp;amp;D is storytelling. You and your friends tell a story together, guiding your heroes through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more. You can also explore the world of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons through any of the novels written by its fantasy authors, as well as engaging board games and immersive video games. All of these stories are part of D&amp;amp;D.</description>
