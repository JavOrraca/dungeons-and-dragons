# D&D Adventures

This project was developed using the R programming language, the blogdown package, and the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/) Hugo theme (theme creator: [Radosław Kozieł](https://twitter.com/panr)). I convinced some friends to learn Dungeons & Dragons and I am using this site to keep track of our story and share resources for people interested in learning Dungeons & Dragons. This is my first time playing in over 20 years and also my first time coordinating a game as Dungeon Master ("DM"), so I plan to share newbie DM tips as well.

## How to clone this project or create your own Terminal website

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git) and pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. You can also include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your blog content (default is `content/posts`)
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink"]
  themeColor = "orange"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

  # set all headings to their default size (depending on browser settings)
  # it's set to `true` by default
  # oneHeadingSize = false

[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"
    subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
    owner = ""
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "Terminal"
      logoHomeLink = "/"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently `main menu` doesn't support nesting.

## Post archetype

See the basic `post` file params supported by the theme — https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/archetypes/posts.md

## Add-ons

- **Comments** — for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html.
- **Extended Head** — please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html
- **Extended Footer** — please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_footer.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html

## How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory run:

```
$ hugo server -t terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to edit the theme

If you have to override some of the styles, **you can do this easily** by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

Otherwise, if you really want to edit the theme, you need to install Node dependencies. To do so, go to the theme directory (from your Hugo root directory):

```
$ cd themes/terminal
```

and then run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm i yarn
$ yarn
```

## Data Persistence and Deployment

If you're building your first website with R and blogdown, and you're also new to site deployment, I'd recommend a few steps:

* Push your data to [GitHub](https://github.com/) - It's free
* Deploy your site using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - It's free
  * If you don't mind using an auto-generated URL that Netlify offers, you can deploy your git-backed website build to Netlify for free (hence the ugly URL this live site sits on, _BUT_ it's free, so I don't care)
